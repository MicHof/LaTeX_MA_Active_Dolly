\section{Overview}
In different states of the project different kind of tests were performed. As a first step bench tests were done to verify the developed software. Following that, several tests on the actual dolly, with the dolly in standstill and no trailers connected, were made.

\section{Bench-Testing}
\label{sec:bench-testing}
\subsection{ECU-setup}
\subsection{VTM maneuver verification}
\begin{itemize}
	\item include simulation results for maneuver of controller being run inside VTM
	\item perhaps include some picture of the video-output, with the actuated truck
	\item plots for maneuver (steering input, speed over time)
	
\end{itemize}
\subsection{CAN verification}
\begin{itemize}
	\item check output from ASF with arduino
	\item check ECU CANs, make sure they differ in output
	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fault detection system verification}
\label{sec:fault_detect_test}

\begin{itemize}
	\item send faulty inputs
	\item show plot of faulty input and system reaction
	
\end{itemize}

\section{Vehicle testing}
\label{sec:vehicle-testing}

\subsection{System calibration}
\subsection{Actuator tests}
\subsection{Algorithm evaluation}
\subsection{Sensor testing}

\begin{itemize}
	\item test angle sensor offline
	\item zero IMUs, make sure paired sensors show the same outputs
	
\end{itemize}


\section{Track testing}
\label{sec:track-testing}

\subsection{Testmaneuvers}

\begin{itemize}
	\item lit research for standard maneuvers
	\item sine-wave
	\item outline critical parts of maneuver
	\item figure with SA over time
	\item expected behaviour from simulation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Testenvironment AstaZero}

\begin{itemize}
	\item overview of AZ
	\item map in appendix?
	\item restrictions of environment
	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Testmatrix}

\begin{itemize}
	\item checklist for launch
	\item parameters that very varied
	\item different runs
	\item planned maneuvers
	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Test setup and instrumentation}

\begin{itemize}
	\item detailed description of placement of sensors, wiring, logging-PC
\end{itemize}
