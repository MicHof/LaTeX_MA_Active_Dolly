\section{Functionality architecture}
\label{sec:func_architecture}

The software architecture \gls{CAN} be divided into four different parts using the functionality architecture developed at Volvo GTT. Figure \ref{fig:funct_architecture} shows the different parts this architecture:

\end{figure}

The \gls{HMI} is the interface between the driver and the vehicle. The driver can input requests to the vehicle, for example a steering angle via the steering wheel or a torque request via the accelerator pedal. The driver gets feedback from the vehicle about the vehicle's state, for example via the speedometer.

The vehicle motion management (VMM) contains the high-level controllers for the vehicle's motion and stability. It has an time horizon up to one second. As an input it gets the request of the driver from the \gls{HMI} and transforms these requests into requests for the actuators of the vehicle. These request are then sent to the \gls{MSD}. From the \gls{MSD} the \gls{VMM} receives information about the state of the actuators and the current capabilities.

The \gls{MSD} contains the actuators and low-level controllers of the vehicle. In there the requests from the \gls{VMM} are executed. Information about the status of the actuators is sent both to the \gls{VMM} and the vehicle plant.

The vehicle plant corresponds to the whole vehicle.
\\
In different kind of tests, the parts functionality architecture are either simulated or real hardware is used. The more advanced the development is, more and more of the functionality is shifted from simulation to actual hardware. For the development and first testing of the vehicle model controllers described in chapter \ref{chap:steering_model}, all the parts were simulated in Simulink. For the \gls{HMI} lookup tables were used for the steering angle and vehicle speed input. The \gls{VMM} consists of the vehicle model controller. The steering actuators in the \gls{MSD} domain were simulated by implementing a first order filter and a time delay, that represents the delay caused by the hydraulic system. For the vehicle plant the \gls{vtm} library (see section \ref{sec:VTM}) was used. Figure \ref{fig:funct_architecture_sim} shows how the parts are divided to different systems.

	\label{fig:funct_architecture_sim}
\end{figure}\\
As a next step \gls{HIL} tests were performed (see section \ref{sec:HIL}). In that case the \gls{MSD} are no longer simulated but the actual dolly together with the \gls{MABII}, which is needed as an interface between the \gls{MSD} and the other parts of the functionality architecture, is used. The \gls{HMI}, \gls{VMM} and vehicle plant are still simulated in Simulink. Figure \ref{fig:funct_architecture_hil} shows how the parts are divided to different systems.

\end{figure}\\
As the final step testing on a test track will be performed. There a complete vehicle combination will be used. This corresponds to the vehicle plant of the functionality architecture. The \gls{HMI} domain is represented by the driver of the vehicle. The \gls{VMM} is running on the \gls{MABII}, which works as an interface between the \gls{VMM}, the dolly and the vehicle. Figure \ref{fig:funct_architecture_track} shows how the parts are divided to different systems.

\section{Matlab/Simulink environment}
\label{sec:matlab}

%%\subsection{FMI toolbox}



\subsection{dSpace RTI-blockset}
\label{dSpace_RTI}
The dSpace RTI-Blockset (Real-time interface) is a plug-in for MATLAB/Simulink that allows you to connect a simulink-model to the different inputs and outputs of the \gls{MABII} There are \gls{RTI}-blocks for CAN, Ethernet, and the analog and digital outputs of the \gls{MABII}
In this project the \gls{RTI} \gls{CAN} MultiMessage and the \gls{RTI} Ethernet (UDP) Blocksets were used.\\ 
\subsubsection{RTI \gls{CAN} MultiMessage Blockset}
The \gls{RTI} \gls{CAN} MultiMessage blocks establish an interface between the physical \gls{CAN}-Buses of the \gls{MABII} and the simulink-model running on the \gls{MABII} There are four different blocks in this blockset: 

In the "GeneralSetup" block the paths of the model root and the destination folder for generated files are set. 

In the "ControllerSetup" block first the name of the controller has to be set. After that the physical CAN-Bus, that should be used, is set by choosing a module number and a controller number. How the module- and controller numbers have to be set for the different CAN-buses of the \gls{MABII} is shown in \ref{tab:CAN-layout}.
\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\caption{CAN-layout MABII}
	\label{tab:CAN-layout}
	\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|}
		CAN   & Module number & Controller number & \gls{ZIF} -Pin CAN-High & \gls{ZIF} -Pin \gls{CAN}-Low  \\ \hline
		CAN1     &       1 & 1  & c2 & c3         \\
		CAN2   &      1 & 2  & b2 & b3    \\
		CAN3 &      2 & 1 & B2 & B3        \\
		CAN4& 2 & 2 & A2 & A3  \\
		CAN5& 3 & 1 & P2 & P3 \\
		CAN6& 3 & 2 & N2 & N3 \\
	\end{tabular} \\
\end{table}

After setting the module- and controller number the identifier format has to be set to either standard or extended format, the transceiver type must be chosen between ISO11898-2 and ISO11898-6. ISO11898-2 is used for a high-speed medium access unit and ISO11989-6 for the selective wake-up functionality of a high-speed medium access unit. If needed, a termination resistance of 120 Ohms can be set in the block as well. As a last step the Baud rate of the \gls{CAN}-bus has to be defined.


In the "Main Block" block a dbc-file is connected to one of the controller blocks, that were created before. A "ControllerSetup" block \gls{CAN} only be connected to one "Main Block" at a time. When the dbc-file is loaded in the "Main Block", the different messages and signals that are specified in the dbc-file can be chosen as inputs and/or outputs of the "Main block". For signals that should be transmitted it has to be defined when they should be transmitted. There are different ways to specify this. One way is to set a cycle time in the simulink model, that determines with which frequency the signal is sent out. Another way is to use triggers that trigger the transmission every time a specific event happens. This \gls{CAN} be set in the tab "Messages" under "Triggering".
\subsubsection{RTI Ethernet (UDP) Blockset}
The \gls{RTI} Ethernet (\gls{UDP}) Blockset was used for two purposes: On the one hand for the \gls{HIL} -testing (see section \ref{sec:HIL}), on the other hand for the \gls{CAN}-bus extension of the \gls{MABII} (see section \ref{sec:can_bus_extension_software}). The \gls{RTI} Ethernet (UDP) Blockset contains four different blocks:\\
The "Ethernet\_UDP\_SETUP" block consists of two pages. In the "Unit" page the main settings for the Ethernet are made. First the interface name has to be chosen. Then the board type has to be selected. There are two types of boards: "ETH Type 1" and "ECU Type 1 ETH". If the Ethernet cable is connected to the Ethernet port of the \gls{MABII}, "ETH Type 1" has to be chosen. The module number, which has to be set in the next step, must be set to 1 since the used \gls{MABII} only has one module.
After that, the local \gls{IP} address has to be set.\\
On the options page of the setup block up to four different sockets \gls{CAN} be enabled. For each socket a local port number, the remote ip address and the remote port number have to be set.\\
 
The "Ethernet\_UDP\_RX" block is used to receive data over Ethernet. To set up this block the board type, module number and socket number need to be set corresponding to the settings that were made in the "Ethernet \gls{UDP} Setup" block. Furthermore the maximum message size \gls{CAN} be defined. Outputs of this block are the received data, the message size and a status. The datatype of the received data is uint32. If the data wasn't transmitted as uint32 it needs to be decoded. In the demo for the Ethernet blocks a block called "DSDecode32" \gls{CAN} be found. With this block the decoding \gls{CAN} be done, by choosing the desired output data format. To get the single signals the output of that block just needs to be demuxed. If the data type of the transmitted data was already uint32 the signal \gls{CAN} be demuxed right away.

The "Ethernet\_UDP\_TX" block is used to send data over Ethernet. This \gls{CAN} be done in a similar way as for the receive block. The only difference is that in the transmit block additionally a send timeout \gls{CAN} be set. The maximum message size must match the port width of the data that is send out. It \gls{CAN} be calculated by:
\begin{equation}
data\ port\ width=(MaxMessageSize + 3) / 4
\end{equation}
The inputs to the transmit block are the data to transmit, the message size and a constant to enable the transmission. The data format of the data to transmit needs to be uint32. Similar to the receive block a so called "DSEncode" block \gls{CAN} be found in the demo for this blockset. This block encodes muxed signals of different types in a way, that they \gls{CAN} be transmitted with the transmit block. In the "DSEncode" block the data type of the different signals, that are put in the block, need to be specified.

The "Ethernet\_UDP\_INTERRUPT" \gls{CAN} be used to make the hardware interrupts available as trigger sources.
\subsection{Virtual Truck Modelling Library}
\label{sec:VTM}
The \gls{VTM} is a computational framework used within Volvo Trucks to simulate the dynamic behaviours of trucks and combinations. As a library it extends Simulink, where maneuvers, track layout and the trucks kinematic and dynamic properties are linked together and then computed. This toolbox was used as a base for the simulation of the LVC including the dolly for this project. It is possible to run simulation offline with a predefined maneuver and a given environment as well online where these parameters are fed into the calculation live or as measurings from the real-world environment. For online use all relevant parameters and states \gls{CAN} be accessed in Simulink or in case of execution on the \gls{MABII} through ControlDesk as their respective representation of the Simulink variable. 

\subsection{CAN-bus extension}
\label{sec:can_bus_extension_software}

\begin{itemize}
	\item outline data diagram structure
	\item show limitations uf \gls{UDP} (time, reliability, retrans)
	\item timestamping
	
	
\end{itemize}
\section{Steering interface}
\label{sec:steering_interface}
The steering interface block constitutes the interface between the vehicle model controller and the different \gls{CAN}s of the dolly. It is a Simulink model that runs on the \gls{MABII}
Figure \ref{fig:steering_interface} shows the steering interface block with its in- and outputs. 
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figures/steering_interface}
	
	\caption{Steering interface block}
	\label{fig:steering_interface}
\end{figure} \\
The inputs to the block are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Steering angle requests for both the front and  the rear axle of the dolly 
\end{itemize} 
 The outputs of the block are:
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item All signals on the \gls{ETS}-\gls{CAN} for both front and rear axle
 	\item The actual articulation angle between the dolly and the first semitrailer
 	\item The vehicle speed signal from the dolly's \gls{EBS}
 	\item The wheel speed difference from the dolly's \gls{EBS}
 \end{itemize}
 The outputs are used to monitor the dolly's state and for the calculation of the current capabilities (see section \ref{sec:maxi_capabilities}).
 Figure \ref{fig:steering_interface_inside} shows the inside of the steering interface block. It contains \gls{RTI} \gls{CAN} MultiMessage blocks (see section \ref{RTI_CAN}).   
 
 \begin{figure}[h]
 	\centering
 	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/steering_interface_inside}
 	
 	\caption{Steering interface block \gls{CAN} layout}
 	\label{fig:steering_interface_inside_pdf}
 \end{figure} \\
 
 The software CAN-layout corresponds to the hardware CAN-layout described in section \ref{sec:interface_with_dolly}. There are five different CAN-controllers. Controller1 is used to receive the signals of the ASF-Sensor and the dolly's \gls{EBS} system. These signals, except for the "Angle", "Wheel\_BasedVehicleSpeed" and the "WheelSpeedDiffMainAxle" signals are forwarded to Controller2 and Controller3. Controller2 corresponds to the \gls{ETS}-\gls{CAN} of the front axle and Controller3 to the one of the rear axle. The inputs Delta31 and Delta32 are sent to the front \gls{ETS}-\gls{CAN} (Controller2) and rear \gls{ETS}-\gls{CAN} (Controller3), respectively. For the signals "Wheel\_BasedVehicleSpeed" and  "WheelSpeedDiffMainAxle" constants with the value zero are forwarded both to Controller2 and Controller3.
 Controller4 and Controller5 also correspond to the front \gls{ETS}-\gls{CAN} and rear \gls{ETS}-\gls{CAN}, respectively. As mentioned in section \ref{sec:interface_with_dolly} this is necessary because different CAN-protocols are used. The signals received from those Controllers, together with the signals from Controller1, that weren't forwarded, are outputs of the steering interface block.
  
\section{ControlDesk monitoring environment}
\label{sec:control_desk}
The software used to monitor the Simulink model running on the \gls{MABII} and for logging of data is called dSpace ControlDesk. It also provides the possibility to control the Simulink model running on the MABII, for example by changing parameters like constants in the model. Therefore it was used for bench-testing the dolly system (see section \ref{sec:bench-testing}) to directly send steering angle request to the \gls{ETS}-\gls{CAN} via the steering interface (section \ref{sec:steering_interface}). In ControlDesk the CANs that the \gls{MABII} is connected to \gls{CAN} be monitored as well. This is very useful for checking if all systems work correctly.

\section{Arduino IDE and applications}
\label{sec:arduino_applications}

The Arduino system provides an \gls{IDE}  written in Java, providing cross-platform support. It is used to develop the code as well as compiling the code and subsequently uploading it into the microcontroller via the computers serial interface. Within the IDE it is also possible to load some of the officially supported libraries directly. It conveniently is possible to monitor the computer's serial interface as well, which is the most practical way to monitor and debug code that is executed on the Arduino.
